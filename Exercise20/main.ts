//Question20:Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let countries: string[] = ["Canada", "Japan", "Germany", "Brazil", "Australia", "India", "South Africa"];

for (let i = 0; i < countries.length; i++) {
    console.log(countries[i]);
}
